            <h1>Defending the Cyber Realm</h1>
          </header>
          <img src="a3.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
          <p>There is a widespread belief that as societies and governments become increasingly reliant upon information technology, they in turn are becoming more vulnerable to a whole range of cyber-threats.1 Whether these dangers are capable of generating enough damage to warrant a redistribution of government resources is the question at the heart of this essay. This paper provides an evaluation of the cyber-threat arguing that it deserves recognition as a top-tier priority given that it poses some significant challenges to both national security and economic prosperity. Whilst cyber -crime falls under this category and is estimated to cost the UK economy alone Â£27 billion annually,2 it is simply not feasible in an essay of this length to give it the attention it deserves. Therefore, whilst it is referred to on occasion, a detailed discussion of the topic is omitted from the analysis. Instead the paper argues its case through focusing on how cyberspace could potentially serve as a platform from which ho stile states and terrorist groups could direct attacks against key national infrastructures as well as on other government, military and private sector targets. Furthermore intellectual property theft is identified as a key concern.

            Rather than attempting to justify elevating the status of cyber-threats through relying upon a broad discussion of how these risks fare when compared with more traditional perils, the piece aims instead to detail their severity. It further argues that meeting the cyber-threat is likely to demand a considerable amount of resources but that this is necessary given the consequences for failing to do so could be catastrophic. It does, however, insist that there exists a significant degree of crossover between these and other major threats, so that a cyber defence budget would also often serve the aims of other departments.
