          <p>In June 2012, two years after the initial discovery of the Stuxnet worm,1 an excerpt from David Sanger's then soon to be released book entitled Confront and Conceal was published in the New York Times.2 This piece, purportedly based on the testimony of several current and former American, European and Israeli officials, declared that Stuxnet â€“ "the world's first fully fledged cyber weapon"3 was engineered by the United States and Israel as part of a wider covert operation aimed at undermining the Iranian nuclear program.4 Whilst the United States and Israel had long been suspected of developing this complex piece of malware, Sanger described the nature of their involvement more fully than any previous account.5 Operation Olympic Games, the codename for this alleged joint venture, may well have succeeded in achieving its goal of disrupting Iran's nuclear enrichment program (although this debate is far from settled) but the deployment of a weaponized worm, which would cause physical damage to a nation-state's nuclear infrastructure, is likely to have spawned some rather sour implications for International Politics. It is these that this paper focuses on.

            This article argues that the release of the worm is likely to have: 1) fueled an on-going cyber arms race by demonstrating to other nations the strategic utility of cyber weapons; 2) elevated the severity of the cyber threat by providing a broad range of actors with a template from which to construct their own cyber weapons; 3) set a precedent for the use of cyber weapons as instruments of state policy.

It should be noted that Sanger's account is far from definitive proof that the United States and Israel were the culprits behind the attacks on Iran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. However, regardless of who conducted the assault, the implications raised in this paper still apply given that Stuxnet unearthed itself in the summer of 2010.
